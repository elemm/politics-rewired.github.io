    - Use the same software powering the Bernie Sanders 2020 texting program. Weâ€™ll host your instance of Spoke Rewired at no additional cost, saving you time, money, and headaches. After you run a texting campaign, we can help you analyze its success in delivering messages.
sections:
  - title: Messaging Application
    content: Send event information, links, and images to voters, volunteers, and donors. Conversations requiring texter action automatically appear in their to-do lists. Texters can easily opt-out contacts or escalate trickier conversations to an administrator.
